        Charles Babbage was an English mathematician, inventor, and mechanical engineer. He originated the concept of a programmable
        computer and designed the Analytical Engine, a mechanical general-purpose computer, decades before electronic computers existed.

        His Difference Engine, designed for complex calculations, was a milestone in automation. Though his machines were never completed in
        his lifetime, they inspired future computing giants like Alan Turing.

        Babbage also contributed to fields like cryptography, economics, and statistics. His interdisciplinary work laid the groundwork for
        modern computer science.
